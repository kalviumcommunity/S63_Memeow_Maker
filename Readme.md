 **Project Title:** *Memeow Maker*


**Project Overview:**
**Memeow Maker** is a web app that lets users create customized cat memes by uploading their own photos or choosing from a gallery of funny cat images. The app auto-generates humorous captions and quirky life advice, and users can add their own text. To make things more interactive, users can rate memes with a "Purr" (upvote) or "Hiss" (downvote) button. The memes can then be shared on social media or downloaded for later use.


 **Key Features:**
- **Upload Your Own Cat Photos or Choose from a Gallery:**  
  Users can upload their cat photos or select from a fun selection of preloaded images.
  
- **Random Captions & Life Advice:**  
  Generate funny, random captions and life advice for your meme (e.g., “Don’t let your human tell you when to nap”).
  
- **Editable Text:**  
  Customize text placement, font, and size for the perfect meme.
  
- **Voting System:**  
  Rate memes with two quirky buttons:
  - **Purr (Upvote)** – For memes you love.
  - **Hiss (Downvote)** – For memes you think need improvement.
  
- **Download & Share:**  
  Once you're happy with your meme, download it or share it directly on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook.
  
- **Responsive Design:**  
  The app is fully responsive, working smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
